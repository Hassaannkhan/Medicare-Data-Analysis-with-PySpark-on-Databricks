# Medicare Data Analysis with PySpark on Databricks

*In continuation of my last project, I created this project with one level up, leveraging Databricks to enhance data handling and scalability for Medicare data analysis.*

## Project Overview

This project uses PySpark on Databricks to process, clean, and analyze large datasets related to U.S. cities and Medicare prescription data. The project builds on previous data analysis efforts, aiming to provide deeper insights into prescription patterns, costs, and claims across different regions in the United States.

### Key Problem Statements Addressed:

1. **Loading and Preprocessing Large Datasets**  
   - *How can we load and preprocess large city and Medicare prescription datasets on Databricks using PySpark?*  
   - The project reads U.S. cities data (Parquet format) and Medicare prescriptions data (CSV format), preparing both for analysis by selecting relevant fields and applying transformations.

2. **Data Standardization for Consistent Analysis**  
   - *How can we clean and standardize the data to ensure consistency across diverse datasets?*  
   - The script selects essential columns, renames them for uniformity, and standardizes fields (e.g., converting city and state names to uppercase).

3. **Regional Analysis of Prescription Patterns**  
   - *How can we explore patterns in Medicare prescription claims by city, state, and county?*  
   - By merging city and prescription datasets, the project provides a comprehensive view of prescription claims, enabling regional insights.

4. **Cost and Claim Analysis by Region**  
   - *What are the total counts and costs of prescriptions across different regions?*  
   - The code aggregates and analyzes fields like `total_claim_count` and `total_drug_cost`, facilitating data-driven insights into healthcare spending by location.

5. **Efficient Large-Scale Healthcare Data Analysis on Databricks**  
   - *How can Databricks and PySpark be used for efficient, large-scale data processing in healthcare?*  
   - Leveraging Databricks’ distributed processing, the project demonstrates scalable data analysis techniques essential to healthcare data handling.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PySpark
- Databricks account
- Jupyter Notebook (for local testing)

## Usage Instructions

1. **Setup**  
   - Run this project on Databricks, initializing a Spark session in your Databricks environment.
   - Load datasets stored in Parquet and CSV formats from Databricks’ FileStore or other accessible data sources.

2. **Execute Analysis**  
   - The analysis steps include loading data, cleaning and transforming fields, and performing aggregations for regional insights.
   - Execute cells sequentially to achieve a comprehensive dataset ready for analysis or visualization.

## Data Files

- **us_cities_dimension**: Parquet file containing U.S. city details such as state, county, population, and timezone.
- **USA_Presc_Medicare_Data**: CSV file with Medicare prescription data, including prescriber information, drug details, claim counts, and costs.
